In constructing our phishing keylogger, we employed the Python programming language, utilizing its simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) library as the foundational component. Essential libraries including smtplib, ssl, socket, pynput, time, os, requests, and pyautogui were integrated into the system. Each library was meticulously chosen for its specific role, contributing to the diverse functionalities of the Phishing Keylogger.
